## How the Web Works
- **Client (browser)** sends a request to a **server**.
- The **server** responds with files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
- The browser renders the website using the received files.
- Communication happens over **HTTP/HTTPS** using URLs.

## The Roles of HTML, CSS & JS
- **HTML**: Structure/content (headings, paragraphs, links, images).
- **CSS**: Styling/appearance (colors, layouts, fonts, animations).
- **JavaScript**: Interactivity & dynamic behavior (dropdowns, sliders, form validation).

Think of a website like a human:
- HTML = skeleton
- CSS = skin and clothes
- JavaScript = brain and movement
