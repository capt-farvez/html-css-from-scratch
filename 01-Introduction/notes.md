## How the Web Works
- **Client (browser)** sends a request to a **server**.
- The **server** responds with files (HTML, CSS, JS, images).
- The browser renders the website using the received files.
- Communication happens over **HTTP/HTTPS** using URLs.

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):
- Communication language of the web (Client-Server model).
- Protocol for transferring web content.
- HTTP is stateless (each request is independent).
- Uses request/response model.
- Common methods: GET (retrieve), POST (send data), PUT (update), DELETE (remove).
- Response codes indicate success (200), redirection (300), client error (400), server error (500).

## The Roles of HTML, CSS & JS
- **HTML (Content & Structure)**: Structure/content (headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables).
- **CSS (Presentation & Style)**: Styling/appearance (fonts, colors, spacing, layouts, borders, shadows, background animations).
- **JavaScript (Behavior & Interactivity)**: Interactivity & dynamic behavior (dropdowns, sliders, form validation). Events, popups, modals, form validation, sliders, Http requests, animations.

Think of a website like a human:
- HTML = skeleton
- CSS = skin and clothes
- JavaScript = brain and movement
